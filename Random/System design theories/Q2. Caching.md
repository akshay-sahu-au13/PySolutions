# Caching:

Caching works on the principle of ‘locality of reference’. The cache acts as a local store for the data to speed up the lookup or retrieval. The primary goal of a Cache is to reduce the read latency and amplify the throughput of any application

## How does a Cache work?

A backend application generally stores the data in a database. When a client 
fetches any data, the application queries the database, fetches the data, and 
returns it to the user. The database server runs as a separate process and can 
run on a computer different than the application server.
Reading data from the database is time-consuming since it needs a network call 
and an IO operation to get the data from the file system. If the data is stored 
in a Cache, the read operation will be blazing fast. When the client requests the 
same data repeatedly, it makes more sense to fetch data from the Cache than from 
the database.

## Below are few commonly used types of Cache:

* LRU (Least Recently Used)
* LFU (Least Frequently Used)
* MRU (Most Recently Used)
